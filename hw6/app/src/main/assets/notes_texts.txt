Is there anything more peaceful then taking in the quiet beauty of the setting sun? As the sun descends below the horizon, creating romantic shades of red and orange across the sky, the world has a chance to breathe in and rejuvenate. While sunsets are a literal end to a day, they've also become symbols of peace, harmony, and the promise of renewal. Sunsets are a great reminder to rest and reset our hearts and minds at the end of each and every day.
Even if you aren't able to catch a sunset in person, a well-written line about the setting sun can conjure up many of the thoughts and feelings brought on by the daily event.
